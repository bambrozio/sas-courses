*    1) Create an output table named STORM_COUNT by       *;
*       completing the OUT= option in the TABLES          *;
*       statement.                                        *;
*    2) Run the program. Which data values are included   *;

*       included?                                         *;
*    3) Put StartDate and BasinName in separate TABLES    *;
*       statements. Add the OUT= option in each           *;
*       statement, and name the tables MONTH_COUNT and    *;
*       BASIN_COUNT.                                      *;
